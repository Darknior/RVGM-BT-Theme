<text>The 'Professional Arcade' is a video game console designed by Bally Manufacturing, a Midway team. It was marketed for only half a year before Bally would exit the market. With its Zilog Z80 CPU clocked at 1.8MHz and 4KB RAM (expandable to 64KB), it could display up to 320x204 at 4 colors. It was noted for its very powerful, yet technical to develop for graphical capabilities. The rights for the console were later acquired by Astrovision in 1982, who renamed it to the 'Astrocade'.</text>
