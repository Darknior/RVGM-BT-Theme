<text>Go on, have courage! Be brave, curious; do not flee the fight before you have started! This collection brings forth all the games in your library that you have yet to play. Hidden gems might await you... Whether that may be a homebrew game you added recently or an old game that had a limited release. Maybe there is an old game that scared you away due to its excessive difficulty and unfair mechanics from when you were younger. With the modern tools of savestates and rewinds, it's your turn to strike back!</text>
