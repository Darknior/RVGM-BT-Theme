<text>The 'Professional Arcade' is a video game console, designed by 'Bally Manufacturing', a Midway team. Marketed in 1977 and for a limited period before Bally decided to leave this market. With its Z80 processor clocked at 1.789 Mhz, it was noted for its very powerful graphics capabilities, but also for the difficulty of accessing these same capabilities. Its main flaw was that it was only available by mail order with long manufacturing times. It was Astrovision who renamed it 'Astrocade' in 1982.</text>
