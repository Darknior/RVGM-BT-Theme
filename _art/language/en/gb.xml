<text>The Game Boy is a portable 8-bit handheld console developed by Nintendo in 1989. It is the first in what would be a large line of portable handhelds, succeeding the Game & Watch handhelds developed before it. It was designed by Gunpei Yokoi and Nintendo Research & Development. Featuring a 4MHz processor, 8KB of RAM and a 160x144 dot-matrix display with 4 shades of gray, it was well known for its long battery life lasting around 30 hours on a set of AAs. Tetris was its pack in game, becoming one of its most infamous titles.
A "Light" version with integrated backlight was released in 1998.</text>
