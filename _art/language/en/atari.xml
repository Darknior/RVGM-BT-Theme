<text>Atari, Inc. was originally an American company founded in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney. Atari was considered a pioneer in arcade games, home video game consoles and home computers. The company would trade hands between multiple parties until its eventual acquisition by Infogrames, a French video game publisher. Despite its strong start, the company would face many hardships and fade into obscurity. But under new management, the company has made a comeback, releasing PC hardware under the VCS name.</text>
